# LinkedList
A very basic implementation of Linked List in C++

This is my implementation of a basic Doubly Linked List using templates in C++.
In addition to the basic Linked List operations, I have also added some auxiliary functionalities which help
in manipulating the Linked List.

There are 3 modules in this implementation:
1) Node class -> This module consists of the implementation of a generic node class which consists of generic data, a next 
pointer and a previous pointer.
2) LinkedList class -> This module implements a simple doubly linked list. All the operations pertaining to the doubly
linked list are contained in this module.
3) Main -> This module consists of the main function. This is the driver file where we can test the functionalities of
the implementation.
